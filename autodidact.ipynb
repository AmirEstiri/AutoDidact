The system had been powered up throughout the flight and had been in the zero optics mode since the star/horizon navigation sightings at 3l hours. Crew observation of the manual readout subsequently confirmed that the fluctuation was actually caused by motion of the shaft. The circumstances and time of occurrence were almost identical to a similar situation which occurred during the Apollo l2 mission.\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nPerformance of the guidance, navigation, and control system was normal except for two instances. Random motion observed in the sextant shaft during the zero optics mode was operationally prevented by turning off power to the optical system when not in use. This problem occurred during Apollo l2 and is thought to be caused by a buildup of contact resistance in the slip rings of the half-speed resolver in the sextant (section 14.l.3). The crew reported the 0.05g light did not illuminate as required within 3 seconds after the digital computer had indicated 0.05g. A manual procedure was therefore required to start the entry monitor system, which performed nominally throughout the remainder of entry (section 14.l.5). As a result of the aborted mission, all power was removed from the inertial platform, including heaters, for approximately 80 hours. After powering up and coarse aligning the platform to that of the lunar module, the cormmand module was guided to a successful landing within\\n------\\n'},\n",

The reference voltage is applied to the rotor through slip rings (fig. 14-3), connected as shown in figure 14-4. If any resistance is present in the common ground path through the slip ring, a portion of the reference voltage will appear across the quadrature winding and induce a finite output (different than zero).

The training time was adequate to meet the planned launch date of April ll, 1970, and all training objectives were met. The only difficulty in coordinating the training activities was the scheduling of the lunar landing training vehicle for the Commander. The late availability of this vehicle, the large amount of time required for this type of training, and the need to travel between Houston and Cape Kennedy complicated the training Schedule significantly. Because a primary objective was a field geology experiment as part of the second extravehicular excursion, considerable emphasis was placed on geology training. A week-long geology field trip to train the crew as \"observers\" was completed early in the training cycle. Later field trips emphasized practical geological procedures and timelines.

The problem resulted from loose or misaligned plumbing components in the dog-leg portion of the tank fill path.

During the detanking sequence, the heaters were on for about 8 hours, but it was believed that no damage would be sustained by the tank or its components because of the protection afforded by intermal thermal switches. However, the use of the heaters in detanking required that the switches open under a load of 6 amperes at 65 V dc, twice the normal flight operating conditions, for each heater.

Analysis of related fuel cell parameters confirmed this discrepancy to be a loss of instrumentation readout and not an actual loss of the regulated nitrogen pressure. Performance of fuel cells l and 3 degraded within 3 minutes after the Oxygen tank 2 pressure dropped.

The system had been powered up throughout the flight and had been in the zero optics mode since the star/horizon navigation sightings at 3l hours. Crew observation of the manual readout subsequently confirmed that the fluctuation was actually caused by motion of the shaft.

Random motion observed in the sextant shaft during the zero optics mode was operationally prevented by turning off power to the optical system when not in use. This problem occurred during Apollo l2 and is thought to be caused by a buildup of contact resistance in the slip rings of the half-speed resolver in the sextant (section 14.l.3). The crew reported the 0.05g light did not illuminate as required within 3 seconds after the digital computer had indicated 0.05g. A manual procedure was therefore required to start the entry monitor system, which performed nominally throughout the remainder of entry (section 14.l.5). As a result of the aborted mission, all power was removed from the inertial platform, including heaters, for approximately 80 hours. After powering up and coarse aligning the platform to that of the lunar module, the cormmand module was guided to a successful landing within\\n------\\n'},\n",

Analysis of related fuel cell parameters confirmed this discrepancy to be a loss of instrumentation readout and not an actual loss of the regulated nitrogen pressure. Performance of fuel cells l and 3 degraded within 3 minutes after the Oxygen tank 2 pressure dropped. The degradation is considered to have been caused by the fuel cell oxygen shutoff valves closing abruptly because of the shock generated when the bay 4 panel separated.

During both periods of throttle increase, the roll-gimbal drive actuator traveled approximately l.35 degrees negatively from its value at ignition. These excursion were somewhat larger than expected, but simulations have since shown them to be normal and result from engine compliance and mistrim. Spacecraft dynamics were nominal throughout the firing. The first transearth midcourse correction was the last maneuver to use the descent propulsion system. The maneuver was performed by manually controlling pitch and roll using the hand controllers and by automatically controlling yaw with the abort guidance system attitude-hold mode.

With the high-gain antenna in the wide beam mode and nearly boresighted, the uplink and downlink signal strengths should have been at least equal to the signal strength obtained with an omnidirectional antenna. A comparison of the wide-, medium-, and narrow-beam transmit and receive pat-- terns indicates the high-gain antenna mode was in a medium-beam, manual mode at the time of acquisition and remained in this configuration until the reacquisition mode was selected at 55:00:10.\\n------\\nResult 2:\\nAt approximately 56 hours, the high-gain antenna experienced an apparent switch from narrow to wide beamwidth, with a resultant temporary loss of telemetry data. This occurrence coincided with the oxygen tank pressure loss. Post-separation photographs of the service module show damage to the high-gain antenna, which is attributed to the loss of a Service module outer panel. This damage, as discussed in reference l, caused the beam switch and the resultant loss of data.\\n\\nFrom 101:53:00 to 102:02:00 and from 123:05:00 to 123:12:00, the communications system was powered up to the extent necessary to transmit high-bit-rate telemetry data using the omnidirectional antennas.
